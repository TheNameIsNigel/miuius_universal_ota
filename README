These files allow MIUI updater to flash OTA updates from either ClockworkMod recovery, AmonRA recovery,
or TeamWin Recovery Project.

Since there is no way to accurately determine the currently installed recovery, this system requires touchfiles to
work properly.

To use:

Copy the files in the ROM folder to their corresponding locations. Make sure your updater-script sets permissions
on /system/xbin to 755.

Users must create one of the following files on their SD Cards:

For AmonRA recovery:
  /sdcard/MIUI/ota.config.amonra

For TeamWin Recovery Project:
  /sdcard/MIUI/ota.config.twrp

For ClockworkMod Recovery simply make sure none of the above files exist!
